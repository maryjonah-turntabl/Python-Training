## PYTHON Short Course

### Meeting 2 (12th April 2022) - Testing

#### Introduction

- We were to complete **[Sedem's Task on using testplan](https://github.com/SedemQuame/testplan-practice)** to implement and write tests for _modulo operation_, _math exponent_ and _natural log_.

#### Setup

- Install `testplan` package using the command  
  `pip install https://github.com/morganstanley/testplan/archive/main.zip`

- Test my code using  
  `python mary_calculator_test.py`

- Ensure you have python installed.

- Logic for calculator:
  - mary_calculator.py
- Tests for logic:
  - mary_calculator_test.py

**NB**: I am looking forward to replicating the task in Flask.
